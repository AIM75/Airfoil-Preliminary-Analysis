# Airfoil-Preliminary-Analysis
this repo will be a collection of airfoil analysis codes that automates, facilitates, and accelerate the required analysises of the airfram, including: 
+ preliminary aerodynamics analysis.
+ Thrust calculations.
+ drag estimations on both laminar and turbulent.
+ Fuselage dimensions.

***note: the codes will be in the form of both separate functions using matlab, but not limited to, and a final product/form of library***
